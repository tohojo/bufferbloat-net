              <h1>Bufferbloat</h1>
              <p>Bufferbloat is the undesirable latency that comes from a router
              or other network equipment buffering too much data.</p>

              <p>The <a href="{{ "/bloat/wiki/" | relURL }}">Bufferbloat</a>
              projects provide a webspace for addressing chaotic and laggy
              network performance. We have a number of projects in flight:</p>

              <ul>
              <li><strong><a href="/bloat/wiki/What_can_I_do_about_Bufferbloat/">What Can I Do About Bufferbloat?</a></strong> 
              If you have bad latency/lag, or someone has told you there is Bufferbloat in your network, 
              this page lists several steps you can take to measure the bloat in your network, and to solve it completely.</li>

              <li><strong><a href="/bloat/wiki">
              The Bufferbloat Project</a></strong> has largely addressed
              latency associated with too much buffering in routers. 
              The cake algorithm (and its predecessors CoDel and fq_codel algorithms) are the first 
              fundamental advances in the state of the art of network Active Queue Management in many, many years. 
              These algorithms have been deployed in millions of computers, and reduce the induced 
              delay from competing traffic on a bottleneck link to the order of 20 msec.</li>

              <li><strong><a href="/make-wifi-fast/wiki">
              The Make-Wi-Fi-Fast Project,</a></strong> with many of the
              same team members as the Bufferbloat project, intends to improve
              Wi-Fi's speed and use of the spectrum by inserting CoDel/fq_codel
              into the Wi-Fi queues, and actively measuring the power required
              for successful transmission, in order to minimize contention and
              interference on the RF channel. 
              As of early 2017, our efforts to remove queueing latency and add Airtime Fairness 
              to Wi-Fi stacks have borne fruit. See the <a href="/make-wifi-fast/wiki/">Make Wi-Fi Fast Status</a> page.

              <li><strong>The Request to FCC for Saner Software Policies</strong>
              is a response to Docket ET 15-170 which appears to require vendors
              to lock down the software in Wi-Fi routers, prohibiting
              experimentation and field testing of new techniques. Read
              the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160429233622/http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20151014005564/en#.Vh4ojflViko"

              <p>These projects are all united by a desire to:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Gather together experts to tackle networking queue
                management and system problem(s), particularly those that affect
                wireless networks, home gateways, and edge routers</li>

                <li>Spread the word to correct basic assumptions regarding
                goodput and good buffering on the laptop, home gateway, core
                  routers and servers.</li>

                <li>Produce tools to demonstrate and diagnose the problem</li>

                <li>Make experiments in advanced congestion management</li>

                <li>Produce patches to popular operating systems at the device
                driver, queuing, and TCP/ip layers to fix the problems.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>There are <a href="https://lists.bufferbloat.net/"
              class="external">several mailing lists</a>, git repositories, and
              people here that are attempting to address the Bufferbloat and
              making Wi-Fi fast issues at various levels. We welcome you to join
              us in this endeavor!</p>

              <h3 id="Help">Help Us</h3>

              <p>We welcome all manner of help, either by writing code, or installing and testing our firmware in a wide variety of test situations.</p>
