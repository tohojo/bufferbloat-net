**** ECN issues\
http://icir.org/floyd/ecnProblems.html

**** Enabling ecn on osx

****\* Normally\
Re:\
http://icir.org/floyd/ecn.html

MAC OS X:\
Leopard 10.5.0 implements ECN, controlled by the variables
"net.inet.tcp.ecn\_negotiate\_in" and "net.inet.tcp.ecn\_initiate\_out".
Reported by Rui Paulo, 2007.

****\* For tunnels

ECN friendly behavior\
gif can be configured to be ECN friendly, as described in
draft-ietf-ipsec-ecn-02.txt. This is turned\
off by default, and can be turned on by IFF\_LINK1 interface flag.

Without IFF\_LINK1, gif will show a normal behavior, like described in
RFC2893. This can be summarized\
as follows:

Ingress Set outer TOS bit to 0.

Egress Drop outer TOS bit.

With IFF\_LINK1, gif will copy ECN bits (0x02 and 0x01 on IPv4 TOS byte
or IPv6 traffic class byte) on\
egress and ingress, as follows:

Ingress Copy TOS bits except for ECN CE (masked with 0xfe) from inner to
outer. Set ECN CE bit\
to 0.

Egress Use inner TOS bits with some change. If outer ECN CE bit is 1,
enable ECN CE bit on the\
inner.

Note that the ECN friendly behavior violates RFC2893. This should be
used in mutual agreement with the\
peer.

## History
{{< issue_journal date="2011-01-24T15:48:58" author="Dave Täht" >}}
I note the estimate above is just about how long it would take to get
into the tracker, not how long the remaining tasks will take. Most are
prio 2 or less from my standpoint, others will differ.

My personal goal is to have 24/7 capable web site(s) that doesn't
require more than a few hours a week to maintain. Certainly I hope some
clones arrive.
