Cake FAQ
========

\[cake\] is the comprehensive queue management system the bufferbloat
project has been working on since 2013 and is nearing release. It is the
rollup of 3 years of deployment experience using the htb + fq\_codel
based <link>sqm</link>-scripts.

What was the origin of the name?
--------------------------------

Initially it came from the movie 2010 where an American was trying to
explain the idioms "Easy as pie", and "Piece of cake" to a Russian, who
kept getting it wrong. Where it started was when Dave Taht tried to
explain the need for a comprehensive queue management system to an
audience in the ietf aqm working group, and was basically booed off the
stage.

Later on it became a reference to the game "portal" - where, at the
conclusion of the game, the AI promises that: "everyone will have cake".

It is also (in a grand tradition of RED vs Blue) a backhanded reference
to "Pie", which is a competing AQM algorithm missing many of the
features of cake.

The backronym invented for it became "Common Applications Kept Enhanced"
- which is also, actually, exactly what it does.

Despite our affection for the name there is still time to change it to
something else - googling for "cake shaper" does not result in anything
useful. CQM, SQM would seem to have more useful google-fu, but...

When should I use cake?
