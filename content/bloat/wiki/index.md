Introduction to Bufferbloat
---------------------------

Bufferbloat is the undesirable latency that comes from a router or other network equipment buffering too much data. 

**TL;DR**

1. To measure bufferbloat, go to
[Waveform](https://www.waveform.com/tools/bufferbloat),
[Speedtest.net](https://speedtest.net/), or 
[Cloudflare](https://speed.cloudflare.com/),
 or read more at the [Tests for Bufferbloat](./Tests_for_Bufferbloat.md) page.
2. To fix your bufferbloat, check out [What Can I Do About Bufferbloat?](./What_can_I_do_about_Bufferbloat/)

The Details
-----------

We've written an [introduction](./Introduction.md) to the bufferbloat problem
that we believe is both accessible to non-technical readers and
informative to techies. We recommend you start there to get a feel for
the nature and scope of the problem. Then, read our
[mission statement](Mission.md) to find out what we're doing
about it.

There's also a [glossary](Glossary.md) that goes into more technical depth
on bufferbloat-related terminology. You may find an older
[technical introduction](TechnicalIntro.md) interesting if you
are a programmer or network engineer.

More reading
------------

Many of the [symptoms](CongestionSymptoms.md) of
bufferbloat-induced congestion have an immediate, user-visible impact on
performance. If you're not sure you are seeing these, there are
[experiments](Experiments.md) you can perform on your home
hardware to detect bufferbloat problems. If you want to jump straight to
fixing the problem, we have a
[mitigation and solutions](Mitigations_and_Solutions.md) page.

Much of the original analysis and discussion of bufferbloat took place
on technical blogs. We have collected a
[tasty selection of blog references](Good_blog_discussions.md)
for your reading pleasure.

You can read bufferbloat-related [quotes](Quotes.md) from the great,
near-great, and and not-so-great. A page of unashamedly geeky
[humor](Humor.md) exists as well.

There is also a list of [product](Product.md) specific pages.

Mailing lists and Participating
-------------------------------

Our project has very active [mailing
lists](https://lists.bufferbloat.net) on which we're developing
anti-bufferbloat fixes, diagnostic tools, documentation, and other fun
things. You can also look at a [ToDo](ToDo.md) list of projects that
need work.
